# 320-project-5
Fifth and final Project for CMSC320 Introduction to Data Science

This tutorial is about exploring and analyzing data from the College Scorecard. The College Scorecard is a part of the U.S. Department of Education. The goal of the scorecard is to make colleges more transparent by providing data sets about colleges around the United States. Students can see information about diversity, tuition, number of degrees per major, numbers of students, post-school salaries, and much more. This information is very helpful for people who are applying to college. It is important for prospecting students to try to get a personal understanding of potential colleges from the perspective of current students, as well as a fact-based understanding from reading up on data that has been left out of their college tours and brochures. Students can use the College Scorecard to compare and contrast the colleges of their choice in order to make sure they are picking the school that is right for them. The scorecard is also helpful for universities, because they can compare themselves to other schools and improve by replicating the techniques of the successful schools.

We will specifically look into diversity and tuition on college campuses. We will predict how much college tuition is paid by each race depending on location. This will give us insight into how tuition impacts the racial demographics of college institutions. The data we are using was last updated on October 30th, 2018.

Here are two helpful links that can help with understanding interaction terms that were used to predict college tuition:
